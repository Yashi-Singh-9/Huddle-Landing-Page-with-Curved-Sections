## Overview

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup for accessibility.
- CSS custom properties for a consistent color scheme.
- Flexbox for responsive layouts.
- Media queries for mobile-first design.
- Simple email validation in JavaScript.
- Font Awesome for social media icons.

### What I Learned

During this project, I reinforced my skills in creating responsive layouts using CSS Flexbox and media queries. I also implemented simple client-side validation for the email subscription form using JavaScript.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to explore more complex email validation techniques and improve accessibility by incorporating ARIA attributes for interactive elements. I also plan to experiment with CSS Grid for more complex layouts.

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Email Validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - This helped me implement simple client-side email validation.
- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide was instrumental in creating responsive layouts with Flexbox.
